For part 3 of the assignment, I created a graph that outputs the cosine graph with the equation y = 5(2-0.5cos(x)). It uses the vertical axis as the x axis and the horiztonal axis as the y axis. From the user's perspective, the program only serves to run one graph and isn't the most useful program. However, the program is run internally through loops to output values and ASCII art to portray the cosine graph. I checked the graph through an online graphing calculator, checking the maximums and minimums and relative values.

I use two nested for() loops to run through the values and output the x and y values, along with using * to make the graph. In those for loops, I inserted a couple of else-less if loops to track the minimum and maximum values for y. Then at the end, I outputted those stored values and checked with the graph to double check those values.
