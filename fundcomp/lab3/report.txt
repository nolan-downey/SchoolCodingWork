Report for Lab3

	For the final part of lab 3, we were challenged with the task of making a simple menu with choices to perform simple arithmetic processes, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. From the user's persepctive, the program works like this. A menu pops up and asks the user to enter a number which correlates to a certain mathematic function (i.e. 4 = division). If the user picks a number (1-4), then the program asks for the input of two integers, both which will be used for the chosen arithmetic function. Then the program outputs the two integers interacting according to the chosen mathematical process, displays the answer, and returns to the display menu so that the user can start all over again. From the user's perspective, the only way to exit the program is to select the option '5' which will then exit the meny.

	From a programmer's perspective, the main function calls on multiple other functions to perform each of the functions. With a simple while() loop, the main function calls upon functions to 1) display the menu, 2) direct the user's choice to the according function, and 3) perform the mathematical process and output the answer. Logically, this program is written simply, with simple functions for each of the mathematical parts and a simple void() function to display the menu. The most complicated part of the program is the function that takes the user's choice and directs it to the according function, but this is executed using a simple switch statement with 5 cases and a default case.

	Verifying the output of the function was easy to test since the math was very simple. The fine-tuning in the trial and error process came to the inputting of the 5th option (the kill option) and choosing options that were not available. But after several tweaks and fixes, the program should run smoothly.
