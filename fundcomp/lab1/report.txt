The program I have written for part 3 is meant to, from the user's perspective, calculate the force from gravity from one object on another. THe program is written to ask the user for the mass of one object (in kilograms), the mass of the next object (in kilograms), and the distance between the two objects (in meters). It then takes this information and returns a value in Newtons which equals the force of gravity from the objects on each other.

From a programmer's perspective, I definied the variables as floats to give the user the ability to use decimals when inputting each value. I then allowed the answer to return as a value, usually with a large exponent. One issue with my program, from a programmers perspective, is that the user cannot input exponenets as the values. This is beacause I could not figure out how to successfuly accomplish this, as my coding experience is limited.

However, after multiple tests of the program, I ran into few issues with providing the correct answer. Like stated before, the main issue I ran into is that the user must input the values without exponenets, and with this certain equation, this can become quite difficult sometimes. I did enjoy writing this code, as I had to learn a few new syntax options to succesfuly finish such code.
