	For part 3 of this lab, I created a program which handles a data file containing the following information about all 50 states: name, abbreviation, capitol, population, year established, and number of representatives in the legislative branch. From a user's perspective, the program displays a menu of options, 5 to be exact, considering different displays of the data involved. The first option displays every state and its abbreviation (just in case you forgot!), the second option displays which states in the US are the oldest and what year they were established, the third option displays all the capitols, the fourth option displays the state with the largest population and its population, and the final option displays all states with 10 or more representatives in the legislative branch. The program runs much similar from a user's perspective to other menu programs we have created, but this one is much more complicated as it employs the use of a custom class.
	From a programmer's perspective, the function stores each part of the data file into each variable of the class States, and each variable is placed into a vector of the class States. The information stored in each variable of the class is then accessed using different get functions through the use of a menu. The program is not too complicated if you break it down from a programmer's perspective. To compile, I used a makefile to make things easier, as I used a header file (.h), an implementation file, and a main file.
