Problem 1 - Calculate sine

double sine(double x, int n) {
  if (n == 0)
    return 0;
  return pow(x,n)/factorial(n) + sine(x*-1,n-2);
}

Correct Class Solution
double sine(double x, unsigned int n) {
	if (n == 0)
		return x;
	return pow(-1,n)*pow(x, 2*n+1)/factorial(2*n+1) + sine(x,n-1);
}

I believe my logic when addressing the problem was correct, as I was
decreasing n by 2 each time, but now I see why my code might not work.

1 - Identify Objectives
- Allocate memory for a character array
- Iterate through the array to identify the size and value of each component
- Place the smaller value in front of the larger value
Added from Class solution
- Without another data structure, sort the elements
- Write a Function that takes in the array, as well as other variables,
such as locations, and perform the swaps
- The character array should remain intact


2 - Identify Risks and Alternatives
- Risk: Use another data structure like a hashtable
- Alternative: Use recursion to pass the array by reference
- Risk: Will characters be in Unicode or ASCII?
- Alternative: We assume use of Notre Dame machines, so ASCII
Added from Class Solution
- Risk: Need to carefully allocate the character array to prevent segmentation faults
- Alternative: Read in the array from the command line
- Risk: If reading from the command line, we need the length of the array
- Alternative: Write a function that iterates through the characters until it hits the NULL character


3 - Product Development and Testing
- Possibly use a temporary array to compare all values
- Similar to the preview assignment for this class!
- Constantly compare individual values using recursion
Added from Class Solution
- Read in the string from the Command line
- Write a method that counts the number of characters in argv[1]
- Recursively divide the string until we reach the single characters
  - Since we pass the array by reference, we need integers for the start and end values
  - To divide, (use (start+finish)2, and then first half is start to middle, and the second hald is middle to end)
- Recombine and sort the characters at each level
